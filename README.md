# Statistics-Random-process-and-Quantization-in-Communication-Systems
In this repository, we intend to become familiar with concepts of quantization, distribution functions between correlated and uncorrelated variables, as well as random processes, over the course of a series of processes, through conceptual questions and more advanced simulations.
